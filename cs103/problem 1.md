# Problem Set 1

## problem 3: describing the world in set theory

i.

$(C \cup D) \subseteq A \ \& \ (C \cup D) \subseteq B$

ii.

$\exist x \ (x \in Y \ \wedge \  x \notin D)$

iii.

$(x \in A \ | \ x \in S \ \& \  x \in F)$

## problem 4: writing direct proofs

i.

consider an integer $n$ that is odd.

ii.

we need to show that $n^2$ is odd.

iii.

**theorem:**
for any integer $n$, if $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.

**proof:**
consider an odd integer $n$. we need to show that $n^2$ is odd. since $n$ is odd, there is an integer $k$ where $n = 2k + 1$.

$$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2$$
$$= 4k^2 + 4k + 1$$
$$= 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$$

therefore, there is an integer $m$ (namely, $m = 2k^2 + 2k$) such that $2m + 1$ is odd. since $n^2 = 2m + 1$, $n^2$ is odd, as required.

iv.

one could not have used the variable $k$ to denote a new value since $k$ is already declared and initialized to a different value earlier in the proof.

## problem 5: writing proofs by contrapositive

i.

if $a, \ b, \text{and } c$ are all odd

ii.

 then $a^2 + b^2 \neq c^2$

iii.
