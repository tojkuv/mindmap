# agile principles

## plan drive sequential development

- waterpall is the most popular example. this would work great in a domain where there are few unknowns, such as manufacturing.

- **PDSD** attempts to plan for and anticipate **up front** all of the features a user might want in the end product and to determine how best to build them
  
  - **idea** -> better plan -> better understanding -> better execution
  
  - **works well** if applied to problem that are **well-defined**, predictable, and unlikely to undergo **significant change**

- **scrum** (and other agile practices) is based on the **beliefs** that map well to problems having **enough uncertainty** to make **high levels of predictability difficult**

- waterfall model does work, if there are very few underfined problems...(say buiding a house).

## agile manifesto revised

- individuals and interactions *over* process and tools

- working software *over* comprehensive documentation

- customer collaboration *over* contract negotiation

- responding to change *over* following a plan

## agile principles

### variability and uncertainty

- plan-driven process treat product development like manufacturing - **they shun variability** and encourage **conformance** to a defined process

- product development is not like product manufacturing 
  
  - create a **single instance** of a product rather than manufacture **multiple instances**

- employ **iterative** and **incremental development**
  
  - **iterative** acknowledges that we will probably get things wromg before right
  
  - **incremental** based on age-old principle of build some before you build it all

- leverage variability through **inspection, adaption,** and **transparency**

- reduce all forms of **uncertainty simultanaously**
  
  - **end** uncertainty - uncertainty surrounding the features of the final product
  
  - **means** uncertainty - uncertainty surrounding the process and technologies used
  
  - **customer** uncertainty - uncertainty about who wants/needs (start-ups, etc.)

### prediction and adaptation

### validated learning

### work in progress

### progress

### performance
